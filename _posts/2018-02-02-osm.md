We use OpenStreetMap data.  

Our original goal was to *unlock* and spread the word about OSM data.  And since we cared about back country lands, we wanted to focus on trails.

OSM is heavy with road data.  Generating proper trails data is both noisy and error prone.

Quote from State of the Map 2017 in Boulder, <br>"*the road people are all set; the trails people...not so much.*"
