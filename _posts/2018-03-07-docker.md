#### Docker

Docker is technology that allows all of the tools such as GDAL or `tippecanoe` to be installed into a *container*.  If you only have Windows, and you need a certain Linux tool to do computations, the best solution would be to build a Docker container to run the Linux tools.

A Docker container with all of the Geospatial Linux command line tools built in can also be built and delivered.    A good starting point on Docker Containers is [https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)

With Docker its possible to deliver something that runs with all the tools properly installed and configured.

* `docker pull roblabs/tippecanoe`

#### Test to verify install

``` bash
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/data roblabs/tippecanoe tippecanoe \
  -v

# sample response, the version number could be different
# tippecanoe v1.31.3
```

* `docker pull roblabs/gdal:2.1.3`

``` bash
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/data roblabs/gdal:2.1.3 ogr2ogr \
  --version

# sample response, the version number could be different
# GDAL 2.1.3, released 2017/20/01
```
