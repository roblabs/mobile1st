We use OpenStreetMap data and make use of the OpenMapTiles from Klokantech. We build our maps using Authoritative Trails data from the US Forest Service and US Geologic Survey. We take care to use shaded relief and 40 foot contours from the USGS. We also adhere to the National Park Service iconography for a consistent experience.

We also explore image compression and data reduction techniques that we use to fit the entire map into a mobile app.
