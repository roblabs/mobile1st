#### Design for Airplane mode

![](images/airplane-mode.png)

#### Mobile First

* Maps are natively offline
* Natively offline means Raster & Vector Map Tiles are hand built & stored as local assets
* also means that the map data is presented without a server; truly *serverless* maps.
* Updates are managed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.



#### Why this over that?

* *Your trip, your privacy â€” we do not track your location.*
* *Works offline without a network*
* *After the initial app download from the Apple App Store, no server is necessary*
* *We don't track your location*
* *We don't have analytics in our app*
* *We don't care where you go, we just want you to enjoy yourself safely*
