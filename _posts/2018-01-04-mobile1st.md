### Mobile First

Maps are natively offline


Raster and Vector Map Tiles are hand built & stored as local assets

### No Servers

* Since map tiles are local, there is no server
* No privacy issues
* No analytics nor tracking ensures full privacy


Your trip, your privacy â€” we do not track your location.
* Works offline without a network
* After the initial app download from the Apple App Store, no server is necessary
* We don't track your location
* We don't have analytics in our app
* We don't care where you go, we just want you to enjoy yourself safely
