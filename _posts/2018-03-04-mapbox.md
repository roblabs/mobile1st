### `tippecanoe`

Tippecanoe creates vector [tilesets][tileset] from large [GeoJSON][geojson] feature collections. The output is an [MBTiles][mbtile] file that can be uploaded to Mapbox.

Prebuilt binaries exist for macOS and

* uses GDAL tool set for converting to GeoJSON
* `tippecanoe` for converting to MBTiles & joining data

#### `tile-join`

Tile-join is a tool for copying and merging vector mbtiles files and for joining new attributes from a CSV file to existing features in them.

Tippecanoe has a *join* tool called `tile-join` which takes care of joining CSV to GeoJSON.
